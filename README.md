A simple **Snake, Water, Gun** game implemented in **C**.  
This project is a fun take on the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game.

## Game rules

- Snake (0) drinks Water (1) → **Snake wins**
- Water (1) douses Gun (2) → **Water wins**

- Same choices → **Draw**

### Features

- User vs Computer gameplay  
- Random computer choice using `rand()`  
- Clear game result after each round

#### How It Works

1. The program asks the player to choose:
   - '0' → Snake 🐍  
   - '1' → Water 💧  
   - '2' → Gun 🔫  
2. Computer randomly selects one. 
3. The result is displayed: **Win / Lose / Draw**
